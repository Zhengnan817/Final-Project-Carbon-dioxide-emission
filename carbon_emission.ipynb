    "\n",
    "This research question aims to explore the dynamics of carbon emissions attributed to distinct sources—petroleum, natural gas, and coal—within the United States. It seeks to comprehend the emissions produced by these specific sources and discern how these emissions have undergone alterations or variations across a temporal spectrum. The investigation entails examining the quantitative levels of carbon emissions generated by each source individually and collectively, tracking their evolution across multiple time points. The focus is on analyzing the patterns, trends, and potential fluctuations in carbon emissions attributed to petroleum, natural gas, and coal over the specified time frame, thereby providing insights into the changing landscape of emissions and their sources within the country."

    "This research question aims to investigate the predictive capability of different categories of carbon emissions on the annual real GDP of U.S. states over a six-year period. It seeks to understand whether and to what extent the levels of carbon emissions from various sectors can forecast or influence the economic performance, as measured by real GDP, across different states in the United States."
