    "The issue of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is a significant global concern, particularly regarding its impact on climate change and the environment. The United States, as one of the world's top contributors to CO2 emissions, is a focal point for this research. We aim to investigate CO2 emissions in the USA at various levels, including emissions by state, their sources, and their connection to the country's economic performance, measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).This study aims to provide insights into the patterns, factors, and potential implications of carbon emissions in the USA. By comparing this information with the country's economic growth, we hope to reveal the relationship between economic prosperity and environmental impact."

    "Question Statement:\n",
    "Research Question 1: What is the carbon emissions from various sources (petroleum, natural gas, coal) within different states of the USA?\n",
    "\n",
    "This research question aims to explore the dynamics of carbon emissions attributed to distinct sources—petroleum, natural gas, and coal—within the United States. It seeks to comprehend the emissions produced by these specific sources and discern how these emissions have undergone alterations or variations across a temporal spectrum. The investigation entails examining the quantitative levels of carbon emissions generated by each source individually and collectively. The focus is on analyzing the patterns, using clustering to find the pattern in distinct fuel sources, certain distribution of the clusters, thereby providing insights into the changing landscape of emissions and their sources within the country.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Question 2: What is the predictive relationship between the annual real GDP of U.S. states and the various categories of carbon emissions (Residential, Commercial, Transportation, Electric Power, Industrial) for the years 2017 to 2022?  \n",
    "\n",
    "This research question aims to investigate the predictive capability of different categories of carbon emissions on the annual real GDP of U.S. states over a five-year period. It seeks to understand whether and to what extent the levels of carbon emissions from various sectors can forecast or influence the economic performance, as measured by real GDP, across different states in the United States.\n",
    "Research Question 3: Study whether the changes in carbon emissions and GDP from 2017 to 2021 have the same trend.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This research question aims to dissect the correlation and trends between carbon emissions and GDP in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, offering insights into how an unprecedented global health crisis influenced environmental and economic indicators simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research used in the \"Real World\":\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, the carbon dioxide emission is an essential factor to environment. Fisrt thing we are going to do is observing the carbon dioxide emission trend in the histroy by different states, products, and different sources as time goes by. So that we can find out what emission sources is the main factor and when the emissions grows quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last question can observe if or when the relationship between GDP and carbon dioxide emission are decoupled. Because With the growth of GDP, people's environmental awareness gradually increases, the development of more clean technologies and the transformation of renewable energy, GDP growth and carbon emissions are gradually decoupled.\n"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In order to address the research questions and find out the relationship between carbon emissions and economic performance, we planned to collect data from the API and csv. We will integrate and combine datasets from these sources to create a comprehensive dataset. This combined dataset will enable us to conduct an examination of the relationship between economic indicators, energy coefficient, and carbon emissions. By bringing together these datasets, we aim to provide a multifaceted perspective on the environmental impact of economic activities.\n",

    "Roles and Responsibilities:\n",
    "Our project team will consist of members with distinct roles and responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Data Collection and Integration: Ruoyu Chen will be responsible for gathering and integrating data from the data sources and the Data cleaning and EDA.\n",
    "<li>Data Analysis: Wei Lo will be responsible for statistical analyses and draw insights from the integrated dataset.\n",
    "<li>Data Visualization: Zhengnan Li will be responsible for graphical representations to convey our findings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, all our members will take parts in all three roles and separate the tasks."
